# Single Cell RNA Seq Training Seminar

In partnership with 10X Genomics

Monday and Tuesday, 13-14th of December

Instructors: Dr David Powell, Adele Barugahare, Dr Paul Harrison, Dr Nick Wong, Dr Andrew Perry, Nitika Kandhari

## Day Two: Using Cell Ranger, Loupe, Seurat, and Monocle

This workshop, conducted by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform, will cover how to extend analysis to contemporary third-party tools, Seurat and Monocle. We will be walking through the 3K PBMC Dataset Tutorial and extend this to Monocle with some trajectory analysis.

### Suggested Further Reading Material

* [Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) - this book teaches single cell analysis with the bioconductor ecosystem of packages rather than Seurat. Regardless of your preference for Bioconductor or Seurat, it provides an excellent grounding and further depth and rationale behind each step of a single cell analysis.
* [Seurat tutorials for gene expression, spatial & multimodal analysis](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html)
* [Getting started with Signac - the sibling package to Seurat for scATAC analysis](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/overview.html)
