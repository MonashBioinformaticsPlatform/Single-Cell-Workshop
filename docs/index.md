# Single Cell RNA Seq Training Seminar

In partnership with 10X Genomics

Monday and Tuesday, 13-14th of December

## Using Cell Ranger, Loupe, Seurat, and Monocle

Day Two: conducted by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform, will cover how to extend analysis to contemporary third-party tools, Seurat and Monocle. We will be walking through the 3K PBMC Dataset Tutorial and extend this to Monocle with some trajectory analysis.

### Suggested Further Reading Material

* [Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) - this book teaches single cell analysis with the bioconductor ecosystem of packages rather than Seurat. It provides an excellent grounding and further depth and rationale behind each step of a single cell analysis.
